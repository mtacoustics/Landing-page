# Landing-page Refresher
Landing page refresher for HTML and CSS

# Goals
Create a landing template landing page and recreate it to freshen up my html and CSS skills
- find a good template or example website
- Recreate it the best of my ability just utilizing html and css
- maybe add my own flair and design

# Website to model
For this refresher I will be designing and building around the popular website Zola
https://welcome.zola.com

# Reasons for picking
- Clean design not to crowded
- Clean color scheme
- attractive on the eyes


# Timeline
As this is a refresher I aim to spend less than 24 hours on it.

# The big why?
I have not touched HTML, CSS, or Javascript since starting my CS degree.

# Things I want to pay close attention too
- Responsivness to screen size. I would love for it to look good on all screen sizes.
- Commit after every big change. Want solid commit history.

# challenges
Will up date this as I am working to ensure that I am targeting my weaknesses.


# TODO
- finish styling for header-text container. This is over the header img
- Fix the image scaling issues on wider screens
- Go in and fix logo in nav-bar
- find a logo for nav-bar

Tomorrow after fixing the above will start working on the next container.
